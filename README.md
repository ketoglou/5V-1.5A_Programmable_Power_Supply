## Overview
A power supply which can be programmed through PC and set the voltage from 0-5V with 5mV resolution and the current from 5mA-1.5A with 
The PC program can monitor Current and Voltage and Temprature of the voltage regulator.
Minimum load must be 5mA.
The project includes a buzzer that indicates that the fuse burned out and a flashing led to show that it is operating.
